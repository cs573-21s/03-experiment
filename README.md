Assignment 3 - Replicating a Classic Experiment  
===
Introduction
---
There are two parts in our assignment.
- Classical experiment   
As the experiments in Cleveland paper are so classical and fundamental in the history of data visualization, our group replicated experiments in Cleveland paper first. Bar charts, pie charts, stacked bar cahrts are included in our survey.  
   *Github page: https://zihao777.github.io/03-experiment/*  
   *Website: http://47.242.141.68:8000*  
- Radial experiment   
   As an extra part, we want to figure out whether people have a good quantitative cognition for radial bar chart. In general speaking, we designed 3 types of radial bar chart. Each one has 3 bars, 5 bars, 7 bars.  
  *Github page: https://zihao777.github.io/03-experiment/extra/*

To collect the data, we rent a server to deploy our page. Node.js is used to response, required on server, and connect database. The database is managed by MongoDB. All charts are drawn by D3.js.
