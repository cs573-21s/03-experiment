Hypotheses
===
The three vizualizations I used in this experiment were the circular bar plot (testing for angle), the heatmap (testing for saturation gradation perception), and the wordcloud (seeing if font size is discernible in a qualitative way). I generated the data for these experiments using a python script. There are a total of 20 different data tables, one corresponding to a single trial for a given vizualization type (includes 3 columns).

Overall, the results of this study are generall inconclusive. All of the three figures resulted in varying log 2 error levels which differ from the consistent results seen in the paper. If given more time, testing on more participants may have proved helpful in garnering more convergent results. Although after speaking with participants, they did seem to evaluate their relative performance as better on certain tasks than others. For instance, some thought the hue was easier, while others were initially confused about whether to differentiate percent area versus radius. These inconsistencies in the samples could likely explain the drastic variance in the results.


Design + Technical Achievements

- Generating points on circular graphic
- Scaling font based on affine transform
- Custom message + div depending on problem being solved
