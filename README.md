When hovering over the button, it changes to a darker color to indicate what the mouse is selecting. When clicked, the button slightly moves down, as if user was pushing the button.

## Design Achievements
### Use of Color

We chose to use pastel blues and green to add some color while not distracting from the graphs themselves. The graphs had to be black and white, so it was important that the colors were not too intense or eye-catching, such as using red. The button is a darker teal from the background to draw attention to it. There is also a slight shadow behind the buttons for a more modern feel.

### Modern font

Open Sans and Raleway are both popular fonts for webpages because they're modern and minimal. The spacing between the letters in the main header adds to the minimal feel, but still stands out due to its larger font and slight shadow.


### Centered Layout

For an easier viewing experience, we opted for a centered layout. Everything is condensed in a given width to avoid long lines of text and unnecessary eye movements.
